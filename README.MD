# TLDWorkshopRework

<h3>Features</h3>
- Linux support
<br>
- Windows support
<br>
- MacOS support (only Whisky) (Not guaranteed because I don't have a mac anymore)
<br>
- All features of the original except some checks
<br>
- Open source and not closed source and obfuscated
<br>

Why? I love the long drive, mods and I wanted it to work on the SteamDeck
